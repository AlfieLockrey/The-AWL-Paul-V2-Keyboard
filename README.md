The AWL Paul V2 is a follow on from my original 3D printed Alice style keyboard that was gasket mounted and handwired.
In setting out to design the V2 I had some improvements and additions I wanted to include:
- Not require painting or post processing
- Decrease the complexity of the design
- Improve the Acoustic properties of the case
- Not require soldering
- Be more accesible in general to people who come from either the MK or the 3DP community

The final/current version includes:

- Hotswappable PCB with a rotary encoder and USB C
- Leaf springs - similar to the salvation keyboard
- '1-Piece' case design - no sandwich panels
- Wrist rest designed just for the board
- Low profile design so can be used without the rest

This GitHub repo will hopefully contain all the current and past STLs to print the case, plate and wrist rest as well as some DXFs that may be used to cut foam for between the plate and PCB if wanted.

## Availability and Cost

For now, the PCB will be available for sale from myself through Discord using Paypal business invoices as well as the option to purchase the hardware, a printed case or a complete keyboard and wrist rest set. These prices are subject to change and any hardware I sell alone is sold at cost to me (I don't make any money) when purchased with a pcb:

| Item              | Description | Price |
| -----------       | ----------- | ----- |
| PCB               | Soldered PCB              | £35.00 |
| PCB + Hardware    | Soldered PCB + Screws, Inserts, Foam Pads, Feet, Magnets (Optional)            | £45.00 / £50.00 |
| Case + PCB        | PCB with assembled case - just add switches, stabs and keycaps             | £125.00 |
| Case + Wrist Rest + PCB              | As above but with magnets              | £165.00 |

The hardware included when sold / needed to have a complete case is as follows and is for the latest release and is the bare minimum - i.e. you may choose brass or black oxide screws for the front facing screws:
- 6 x M3x10 Cap Head screws (for front covers)
- 2 x M3x8/10 Cap head screws (for feet)
- 2 x M3x14 Cap Head screws (for joining 2 halves)
- 2 x M2x5/6 Cap head screws (for pcb attachment)
- 2 x M2 Washers (Optional but recommended)
- 10 x M3 Brass Inserts (OD: 3.9-4.2mm | Len:4-6mm) (See Section)
- 4/12 8mm Rubber Bumpons (Good to have more. At least 4/12 needed for case/wrist rest)

## Notes on Brass Inserts
The holes in the design that recieve brass inserts are 3.9mm in diameter and vary in length. The case was designed for brass inserts that were 4.1mm in length and meant to have holes that were 3.7mm to 4.0mm. For guidance these brass inserts measure as being 4.28mm at a maximum OD and 3.7mm at their smallest OD. They look like this:

Most M3 Brass inserts will do that are between 4mm to 6mm in length. They may simply require more or less heat/pushing to set them in and some clean up in the form of a tap or knife to remove any plastic in the way of the threads. The important part is that they sit slightly below the surface they are located on and that a bolt, when screwed in, is perpendicular to said surface. Some common sense may need to be applied when choosing and installing inserts :p. All inserts should be tested before final assembly by test fitting a bolt and seeing if they pull out with reasonable force. If they do then they may need to be reset in the hole and possible have some additonal plastic melted into the hole or over the insert to hold it in place.
